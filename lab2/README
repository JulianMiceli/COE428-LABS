Requirment 1 Questions:
1)towers(5, 2, 3) will recursively call towers(4, 2, 1) since the method will compute towers(n-1, from, spare) and spare = 6 - from - dest.

2)towers() will be called before the first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation.

3)the actual move of the stdout of the first recursive call to towers is:
move from tower 2 to 3 and will display towers(0, 3, 1).

4)the second recursive call to towers() will be: move #2 as it invokes towers(1, 3, 2) the recursively calls towers again to invoke towers(0, 3, 2).

5)when towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked, it can be seen that 255 moves are made and are printed out to stdout.

Lab Accomplishments
In the lab, requirments 1 and 2 were met and done so succesfully. The major challenge in the lab was requirmemt 1 read me questions as you needed to really understand the algorithim and implement your code from requirment 2 to help solve the questions. Other than this, requirement 2 went rather smooth.
